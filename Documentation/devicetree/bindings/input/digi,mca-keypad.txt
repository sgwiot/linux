* MCA matrix keypad device tree bindings

The MCA keypad controller is designed to interface with a matrix keypad with
2-point contact keys. The keypad subsystem is capable of detecting, debouncing
and decoding one or multiple keys pressed simultaneously. Key release events
are also detected.

Required Properties:
- compatible:		Should be "digi,mca-keypad"
- rows-io-list:		List of MCA IOs used as row lines.
- cols-io-list:		List of MCA IOs used as column lines.
- linux,keymap:		The definition can be found at
			bindings/input/matrix-keymap.txt

Optional Properties:
- debounce-ms:		debounce filter in ms.
- pwr-off-wakeup:	Enable wake up from power off through keypad events.
- autorepeat:		Boolean, enable auto repeat feature of Linux input
			subsystem.

Example:

	&mca_keypad {
		rows-io-list = <7 9>;
		cols-io-list = <5 17 6 8>;
		pwr-off-wakeup;
		debounce-ms = <10>;

		linux,keymap = <MATRIX_KEY(0, 0, KEY_UP)
				MATRIX_KEY(0, 1, KEY_DOWN)
				MATRIX_KEY(0, 2, KEY_VOLUMEDOWN)
				MATRIX_KEY(0, 3, KEY_HOME)
				MATRIX_KEY(1, 0, KEY_RIGHT)
				MATRIX_KEY(1, 1, KEY_LEFT)
				MATRIX_KEY(1, 2, KEY_ENTER)
				MATRIX_KEY(1, 3, KEY_VOLUMEUP)>;
	};
